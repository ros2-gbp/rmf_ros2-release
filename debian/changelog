ros-iron-rmf-fleet-adapter (1.0.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Provides rmf_fleet_adapter library
    
    The rmf_fleet_adapter::agv component can be used to develop a custom "Full Control" fleet adapter
    
    rmf_fleet_adapter/StandardNames.hpp specifies topic names that are used for RMF integration
  * Provides a prototype read_only fleet adapter implementation
    
    This will be deprecated in the future in favor of a C++ API
    
    To use this fleet adapter, you must implement a "read-only fleet driver" to talk to the fleet adapter using rmf_fleet_msgs
  * Provides a deprecated full_control fleet adapter implementation
    
    This is made to be backwards compatible with "full-control fleet drivers" that were developed in the early stages of RMF
    
    New users should prefer to implement their own fleet adapter using the rmf_fleet_adapter::agv API
  * Uses rxcpp to make the fleet adapters reactive and multi-threaded
  * Has a known memory leak issue which will be resolved in a later release
  * Contributors: Aaron Chong, Charayaphan Nakorn Boon Han, Marco A. Guti√©rrez, Grey, Yadu, Yadunund, koonpeng, methylDragon
